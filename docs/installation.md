# Getting started


## Installation

To run kaamer you will need at least GO >= 1.13 (https://golang.org/doc/install)

This command will download and install kaamer executables (kaamer and kaamer-db) into your `GOPATH`

```shell
export GO111MODULE=on
go get github.com/zorino/kaamer/...
```

You can also download precompiled binaries : https://github.com/zorino/kaamer/releases


## Requirement

Coming soon.. will be based on kaamer-bench and database size.
