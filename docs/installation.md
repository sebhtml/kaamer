# Getting started


## Installation

To build kaamer from source you will need at least GO >= 1.12 (https://golang.org/doc/install)

This command will download and install kaamer executables (kaamer and kaamer-db) into your `GOPATH`

``` shell
go get github.com/zorino/kaamer/...
```

Or you can start by cloning the git repo and install it from there

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/zorino/kaamer.git
cd kaamer
go install ./...
```

Or you can download precompiled binaries : https://github.com/zorino/kaamer/releases


## Requirement

Coming soon.. will be based on kaamer-bench and database size.
